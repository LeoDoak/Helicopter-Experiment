# Paper Helicopter Experiment 

Project Completed for **Dr. Lee's Spring 2024 STT 411 Analaysis of Variance class** 

## Group Members: 
*  Leo Doak 
*  Cole Thibault 
*  Darina Aynaeva

## Experiment Setup: 

## Tests Completed: 

## Conclusions Made: 
* From looking at the data it appears that Helicopter Size was the only significnat factor in determining helicopter descent time. Paperclip size and person who made helicopter did not seem to impact helicopter air time. 

## Possible Reasons for results: 
* Could have more accurately recorded the air time through recording each trial and looking at the exact time the helicopter touched the floor. 
* Paperclip size was not heavy enough to impact the descent time of the helicopter. Could have used a heavier weight for the different trials 
* Could have more accurately cut the helicopters with something like a guillotine paper cutter 
* Could have had one person drop the helicopters and another person handle the time for more consistent results


## Files in Respository: 
*  CSV file  - data from Experiments 
*  R code file  - Code for analyzing and testing 
*  txt file  - Report that explains the experiment setup and draws conclusions between factors

### Presentation: 
* Presentated our conclusions to the class and recieved positive feedback and an A on the project as a whole.
